With Fluent Forms 5.0.8 Conversational Forms come with address field (Free) and Google Maps support in the address field (pro).

== Built-in Data Analysis Tool ==
In version 3.0.0, we have added the most exciting feature that no other WordPress form plugins provide, and that is a built-in data visualization tool. Using the data visualization module, you can analyze your data from your web and contact forms, analyze the data using a pie chart, bar chart, or tabular view. Using the Ninja Tables plugin you can even show the submitted data in the frontend.

== Best Contact Form Plugin in WordPress ==

Everything works with drag-and-drop, which makes creating new forms slightly quicker and more accessible, you will get all the premium components like conditional logic, more than 50 custom fields, numerous 3rd party integrations, a built-in entry management system, and whatnot.

== DRAG & DROP CONTACT FORM BUILDER ==
Our powerful drag & drop form builder allows you to easily create any form you can imagine in a  few minutes without writing any code. Building forms is now easier for you than writing and drawing it on a piece of paper! Not only that, you can easily migrate from other from builder using our migrator that supports Gravity Forms, WPForms, Caldera, Contact Form 7, and Ninja Forms.

== MULTI-COLUMN FORM LAYOUT ==
We have all faced the hassle of long forms, filling out which seems like meeting a Dementor from the Harry Potter series that might suck the soul out of you and leave you dead. These “long” forms are often nothing more than just mismanagement of space. Say, you are showing your potential lead in a form that has ten input fields in it. Now stacking these 10 fields one after one makes it a long, tedious, and scary form. But if you cleverly stack them in 2 or 3 columns, the whole thing looks compact, smart, and not that much scary at all!

This is the most unique feature that helps Fluent Forms stand out from the herd. The **Multi-column form layout** option is a feature that you won’t even find in the premium form builder plugins! And also if you find any, those will not be as fluent, intuitive and easy to use as our one does.

== 100% RESPONSIVE MOBILE-FRIENDLY CONTACT FORMS FOR YOUR AUDIENCE ==
As of the current user behavior throughout the world, a significant portion of your visitors will be visiting your website with their handheld devices. And you do not want to disappoint them with some disoriented contact form. Keeping that in mind, Fluent Forms was developed to make sure that it satisfies devices of all sizes of display.

== CONDITIONAL LOGICS ==
Why irritate your users with unnecessary fields that they do not need? Use WP Fluent Form’s Conditional Logic feature to make your forms more efficient and user-friendly. Show and hide specific fields according to users’ behavior so that they do not have to be bothered with unnecessary fields they do not need to fill up. You can show and hide entire sections or steps (in step forms) if you need using WP Fluent Form’s Conditional Logic.

Whereas, in most of the Contact Form Plugins available, this Conditional Logic is a Premium Feature. But in Fluent Forms, you can enjoy this feature in our free version!

== CONDITIONAL CONFIRMATION ==
Along with Conditional Logics, we have introduced Conditional Confirmations (pro) as well. It allows admins to convey to users customized messages if they do not comply with specific logics, or fail to achieve certain values while filling out forms. For example, you are looking for a value of equal to or more than 2 in a certain field of your form. But what if they put 0 or 1 in that field? In that case, using a conditional confirmation feature, you can let your users know of what went wrong and how to fix it. Remember, this is an entirely different feature than the usual error messages.

== CALCULATOR FOR ADVANCED FORM BUILDING ==
Fluent Forms Numeric Fields and advanced features give you the power to create incredible calculators, simplifying everyday calculation tasks. Whether it's a car loan calculator, BMI calculator, simple mortgage calculator, or tax calculator, creating these tools is a no-brainer with just a few clicks. No coding skills are required, thanks to Fluent Forms' amazing mathematical calculation functions. You can even build payment forms use calculation on your input fields.

== GET REAL TIME EMAIL NOTIFICATION ==
Get notified every time someone fills up a form with entry details. With Fluent Forms, you can also inform your team members every time someone fills up a form and also send back a confirmation email to the new subscriber. Fluent Forms also enables you to automatically send out certain submissions from the email notification process if they fail to comply with specific conditions set by the admin.

== REUSABLE FORM TEMPLATES ==
Why do the same thing over and over again? Isn’t it madness?
Fluent Forms enables you to reuse the same contact form again and again. You can copy the whole setup with a click and make necessary tweaks in a short time, which will save you precious time.

== FLEXIBLE CUSTOMIZATION ==
Customizing your subscription forms has never been easier. According to your need, you can create forms with HTML blocks, tooltips, suitable orientations, custom CSS, etc.
