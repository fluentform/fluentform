One of the best features of any form builder plugin is its ability to create different types of forms. One of the key features of Fluent Forms is conversational forms. With [conversational forms](https://fluentforms.com/conversational-forms/), users get one question at a time, unlike traditional forms. This reduces distraction and results in a higher form completion rate. There are multiple layout options to serve your purpose. There are multiple sharing options for conversational forms, including direct URLs, shortcodes, HTML embedding and more.

== What Our Users Say About Fluent Forms ==

>__Fantastic Form Plugin!__
>I’ve tried a number of premium (and free) WP form plugins including Forminator Pro (by WPMU Dev) and Piotnet Forms. But I’ve come back to Fluent Forms as my favourite. It’s lightweight and easy to use!
- By @jeremywardkcc

>__Best form plugin ever with first class support__

>__Powerful Form Plugin__
>Fluent Forms is very intuitive and easy to use form plugin. I am not an expert in website creation, and learned how to use it very easily. The documentation available in their official website is very usefull, it helps me a lot when in doubt on how to do something. The Pro is even better, and includes some functionalities that are worth it (if you need them, of course). Good deal with lifetime licence. Thank you.
- By @francksdl

>__Excellent Support__
>Excellent customer service. I have fluent forms and fluent CRM, both pro versions, and not only do they work great but the support you get is excellent. Can totally recommend
- By @facua1

>__Free Version Has Options Found only in Premium Plugins__
>This is a fantastic email form. It’s fast (very light weight), easy to use, and the support is great. To boot, the free version also has options usually found only in premium email forms. Don’t waste your time looking for another form. I spent countless hours looking for the “right” form, and this one is it, hands down.
