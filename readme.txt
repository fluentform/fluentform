Starting from v4.3.0, Conversational Forms got even more powerful. Now you have full-on keyboard access. With Fluent Forms Pro, you can enjoy more advanced functionalities, such as payment, coupon, file upload, and checkable grid.

== Built-in Data Analysis Tool ==
In version 3.0.0, we have added the most exciting features that no other WordPress form plugins provide, and that is built-in data visualization tool. Using the data visualization module, you can analyze your data from your web and contact forms, analyze the data using a pie-chart, bar chart, tabular view. Using Ninja Tables plugin you can even show the submitted data in the frontend.

== Best Contact Form Plugin in WordPress ==
Fluent Forms is an extremely feature-rich plugin that delivers a beautiful and bright user interface. Everything works with drag-and-drop, which makes creating new forms slightly quicker and more accessible, you will get all the premium components like conditional logics, more than 30 custom fields, 3rd party integrations, built-in entry management system, etc.

Fluent Forms can be used for your regular contact forms, event forms, online forms and any data collection form. You can connect the form data with many 3rd party CRM without writing a single line of code. And the Best thing is this is entirely free, and it always is free and opensource.

== DRAG & DROP CONTACT FORM BUILDER ==
Our powerful drag & drop form builder allows you to easily create WordPress contact forms and other online forms in just a few minutes without writing any code. Building forms is now easier for you than writing and drawing it on a piece of paper!

== MULTI-COLUMN FORM LAYOUT ==
We have all faced the hassle of long forms, filling out which seems like meeting a Dementor from the Harry Potter series that might suck the soul out of you and leave you dead. These “long” forms are often nothing more than just mismanagement of space. Say, you are showing your potential lead a form that has ten input fields in it. Now stacking these 10 fields one after one makes it a long, tedious, and scary form. But if you cleverly stack them 2 or 3 columns, the whole thing looks compact, smart, and not that much scary at all!

This is the most unique feature that helps Fluent Forms stand out from the herd. The **Multi-column form layout** option is a feature that you won’t even find in the premium form builder plugins! And also if you find any, those will not be as fluent, intuitive and easy to use as our one does.

== 100% RESPONSIVE MOBILE-FRIENDLY CONTACT FORMS FOR YOUR AUDIENCE ==
As of the current user behavior throughout the world, a significant portion of your visitors will be visiting your website with their handheld devices. And you do not want to disappoint them with some disoriented contact form. Keeping that in mind, Fluent Forms was developed to make sure that it satisfies devices of all sizes of display.

== CONDITIONAL LOGICS ==
Why irritate your users with unnecessary fields that they do not need? Use WP Fluent Form’s Conditional Logic feature to make your forms more efficient and user-friendly. Show and hide specific fields according to users’ behavior so that they do not have to be bothered with unnecessary fields they do not need to fill up. You can show and hide entire sections or steps (in step forms) if you need using WP Fluent Form’s Conditional Logic.

Whereas, in most of the Contact Form Plugins available, this Conditional Logic is a Premium Feature. But in Fluent Forms, you can enjoy this feature in our free version!

== CONDITIONAL CONFIRMATION ==
Along with Conditional Logics, we have introduced Conditional Confirmations (pro) as well. It allows admins to convey to users customized messages if they do not comply with specific logics, or fail to achieve certain values while filling out forms. For an example, you are looking for a value of equal to or more than 2 in a certain field of your form. But what if they put 0 or 1 in that field? In that case, using a conditional confirmation feature, you can let your users know of what went wrong and how to fix it. Remember, this is an entirely different feature than the usual error messages.

== GET REAL TIME EMAIL NOTIFICATION ==
Get notified every time someone fills up a form with entry details. With Fluent Forms, you can also inform your team members every time someone fills up a form and also send back a confirmation email to the new subscriber. Fluent Forms also enables you to automatically send out certain submissions from the email notification process if they fail to comply with specific conditions set by the admin.

== REUSABLE FORM TEMPLATES ==
Why do the same thing over and over again? Isn’t it madness?
Fluent Forms enables you to reuse the same contact form again and again. You can copy the whole setup with a click and make necessary tweaks in a short time, which will be saving your precious time.

== FLEXIBLE CUSTOMIZATION ==
Customizing your subscription forms has never been easier. According to your need, you can create forms with HTML blocks, tooltips, suitable orientations, and custom CSS, etc.

If you are interested in having a peak under the hood and see if it can be made more useful, we have that option too!

== MANAGE YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS SMARTLY ==
You are not installing a form builder plugin to lure in 5-10 subscribers, right? What do you do when thousands of visitors subscribe to your website? You will need a smart system to handle such an influx. That is where Fluent Forms can help you manage things easily. Managing your submitted data has never been easier!
