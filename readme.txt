They offer multiple layout and sharing options (direct URLs, shortcodes, HTML embedding, etc.).

[View Conversational Form Demo](https://fluentforms.com/?fluent-form=138)
Fluent Forms Pro offers advanced conversational forms. Users can navigate questions via scroll and key press, and customize fonts, colors, and backgrounds to align with their brand.

== AI Form Builder ==
Say hello to Free AI Form Builder! Fluent Forms AI Form Builder simplifies and speeds up form creation. Just describe your needs to generate effective forms with all necessary fields.

== Accept Payments with Stripe ==
Fluent Forms 6.0 now offers payment fields to free users, allowing Stripe payments for events, donations, or sales with a 1.9% transaction fee. Recurring payments are also included via the Subscription field. Pro removes the 1.9% fee, leaving only Stripe's charges.

== Fluent Forms Report Module ==
Fluent Forms Report Module provides powerful, data-informed insights through three sections: Overview, Payment, and Submissions. The free version includes basic analytics like submission/payment summaries, form ranking, API logs, and detailed charts. The Pro version unlocks advanced reporting, such as partial entry rates, submission data by country, and subscription analytics.

== Built-in Data Visualization Tool ==
Fluent Forms allows easy analysis of form submissions with pie, bar, or tabular charts. As a form or quiz builder, it simplifies data analysis, providing real-time graphical results for surveys or polls.

== Email Notification ==
Get notified every time someone submits a form and also send a confirmation email to the one who fills out the form. To make it more advanced, you can use conditional email notifications to send emails when certain conditions are met.

== Multi-column Form Layout ==
Stack input fields in multiple columns and make the long, boring form appear compact and smart. This will lead to a lower form abandonment rate. There are six types of column containers to choose from.

== Conditional Logic ==
Use [conditional logic](https://fluentforms.com/conditional-logic/) to show or hide form fields based on user behavior, preventing unnecessary clutter. Users can set multiple condition groups by selecting fields and defining rules (e.g., equal, greater than, includes). Conditional logic also allows for automatic email notifications and displaying different confirmation messages based on submission conditions.

== Calculator for Advanced Form Calculation ==
Fluent Forms' numeric field enables creation of smart calculators like car loan, BMI, mortgage, or tax calculators with ease. You can define the acceptable range for these numerical inputs by setting minimum and maximum values.

== Create PDF Files from Form Submission ==
[Generate PDF from your submitted entries](https://fluentforms.com/pdf-generator/) and let users download the PDF file or send it via email. You can use this feature to generate invoices, create reports, or provide order summaries.

== Conditional Confirmation ==
Fluent Forms Pro allows you to send customized confirmation messages to your users if they meet specific conditions.

== Advanced Form Styler ==
Fluent Forms Pro's Advanced Form Styler allows easy contact form customization to boost conversions. Adjust colors, fonts, box shadows, borders, margins, and padding. You can also quickly import styles from previous forms.

== Build Quizzes & Surveys ==
Fluent Forms Pro is a versatile tool, functioning as both a contact form and a powerful quiz builder. As a quiz plugin, it enables the creation of fun quizzes, personality tests, and trivia, with scoring assigned to questions. Users can see their performance immediately after submission or through email. It also supports running surveys and displaying the results.

== Payment Forms ==
Fluent Forms Pro is a powerful solution for creating payment, product order, and donation forms, in addition to contact forms. It easily accepts credit card payments via integration with popular gateways like PayPal, Stripe, Razorpay, Paddle, Square, Paystack, Mollie and Authorize.net.

== One-Click Migrator ==
If you are already using Contact Form 7, WPForms, Caldera Forms, Ninja Forms or Gravity Forms and looking to move to Fluent Forms, you can do this with a single click.

== Fluent Forms CLI ==
Fluent Forms offers a powerful Command Line Interface (CLI) for managing forms without the graphical user interface. The CLI tool allows users to easily create, manage, import/export data, track submissions, and configure settings.

== What Our Users Say About Fluent Forms ==

>__Fantastic Form Plugin!__
>I’ve tried a number of premium (and free) WP form plugins including Forminator Pro (by WPMU Dev) and Piotnet Forms. But I’ve come back to Fluent Forms as my favourite. It’s lightweight and easy to use!
– By @jeremywardkcc

>__Best form plugin ever with first class support__
>This is the lightest form plugin I’ve ever used (except basic CF7 which is not enough for me). Great performances, great UI, great features, and above all, amazing dev/support team!!!
 Plugin is improving almost every week and they listen to you 🙂
– By @yankiara

>__Agency Owner / Web Designer__
>Fluent forms is a great contact form plugin that allows customization and advanced features and addons such as taking payments. As a web designer / agency owner wpmanageninja is my go to for a lot of my software. Sure the software is great, but it is their support that keeps me coming back. I can count on them to assist me when my back is against the wall.
– By @nickyeager123456

>__Powerful Form Plugin__
>Fluent Forms is very intuitive and easy to use form plugin. I am not an expert in website creation, and learned how to use it very easily. The documentation available in their official website is very usefull, it helps me a lot when in doubt on how to do something. The Pro is even better, and includes some functionalities that are worth it (if you need them, of course). Good deal with lifetime licence. Thank you.
– By @francksdl

>__Excellent Support__
>Excellent customer service. I have fluent forms and fluent CRM, both pro versions, and not only do they work great but the support you get is excellent. Can totally recommend
– By @facua1

>__Free Version Has Options Found only in Premium Plugins__
>This is a fantastic email form. It’s fast (very light weight), easy to use, and the support is great. To boot, the free version also has options usually found only in premium email forms. Don’t waste your time looking for another form. I spent countless hours looking for the “right” form, and this one is it, hands down.
